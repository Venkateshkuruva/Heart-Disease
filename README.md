In this project, I conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on cardiovascular health datasets to identify key patterns, trends, and risk factors associated with heart disease. Utilizing Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, I explored various health indicators such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, age, BMI, and lifestyle habits to understand their impact on heart health.

Key aspects of this project:

 ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handled missing values, outliers, and ensured data consistency.
 
 ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis – Generated visualizations like correlation heatmaps, histograms, and box plots to uncover trends.
 
 ✅ Statistical Insights – Identified significant predictors of heart disease using correlation analysis.
 
 ✅ Risk Factor Analysis – Explored how lifestyle choices affect cardiovascular health.
 
Through this analysis, I gained valuable insights into the early detection of heart-related risks, which could contribute to medical research and preventive healthcare strategies.
